# Cherry Leaves Disease Detection

## Project Overview
This project utilizes machine learning to detect powdery mildew in cherry leaves through a streamlit web application.

## Dataset Information
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, containing over 4.000 images from healthy leaves and those affected by powdery mildew, a fungal disease.

## Business Requirements
Farmy & Foods faces a challenge with powder mildew on their plantations. The current method of manually checking each tree for the disease is time-consuming and not so scalabe. As employee spends about 30 minutes inspecting each tree and applying a fungicide if needed. With thousand of cherry trees this process is inefficient.

The IT team proposed an ML system that can detect powder mildrew instantly in leaf images.

### Goals
1. Conduct a study to visually differentiate healthy cherry leaves from those with the powdery mildew.
2. Predict whether a cherry leaf is healthy or has powdery mildew.
